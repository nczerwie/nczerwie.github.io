<p><q>The Mars 2020 Perseverance Rover searches for signs of ancient microbial life, to advance NASA's quest to explore the past habitability of Mars. The rover is collecting core samples of Martian rock and regolith (broken rock and soil), for potential pickup by a future mission that would bring them to Earth for detailed study.</q>-https://science.nasa.gov/mission/msl-curiosity/ </p>

<h2> Objectives</h2>

			<ul class="color">
      			<li>Geology</li>
				<li class="remove"><ol>
					<li> Studying the rocks and landscape at Jezero Crater to reveal the regionâ€™s history.</li>
					<li>Studying the area to understand its historical climate and environment.</li>
					<li>Characterizing the processes that formed and modified the geologic record within a field exploration area on Mars selected for evidence of an astrobiologically relevant ancient environment and geologic diversity.</li>
				</ol></li>
			<li>Astrobiology</li>
				<li class="remove"><ol>
					<li>Determine the habitability of an ancient environment.</li>
					<li>For ancient environments interpreted to have been habitable, search for materials with high biosignature preservation potential.</li>
					<li>Search for potential evidence of past life using the observations regarding habitability and preservation as a guide.</li>
				</ol></li>
      			<li>Sample Caching</li>
				<li class="remove"><ol>
					<li>Obtaining the most promising samples that represent the geologic diversity of the landing site, and document the context of those samples thoroughly.</li>
					<li>Ensuring compliance with future needs in the areas of planetary protection and engineering so that the cached samples could be returned in the future if NASA chooses to do so.</li>
				</ol></li>
			<li>Preparation for Humans</li>
				<li class="remove"><ol>
					<li>Demonstration of In-Situ Resource Utilization technologies would enable propellant and consumable oxygen production from the Martian atmosphere for future exploration missions.</li>
					<li>Characterization of atmospheric dust size and morphology to understand its effects on the operation of surface systems and human health.</li>
					<li>Surface weather measurements to validate global atmospheric models.</li>
					<li>A set of engineering sensors embedded in the Mars 2020 heat shield and backshell to gather data on the aerothermal conditions, thermal protection system, and aerodynamic performance characteristics of the Mars 2020 entry vehicle during its entry and descent </li>
